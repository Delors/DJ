# Overview
The files in this folder contain those character lists used on specific devices for, e.g., setting passwords. For example, iOS uses UTF-8 for passwords, but only a limited selection of characters is actually useable. 

# IMPORTANT
_All files use UTF-8 encoding._ 

For example, the file cp1252.txt simply contains the characters belonging to cp1252. But the used enconding for these characters is UTF-8.
