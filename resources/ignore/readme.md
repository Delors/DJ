The `ignore_<lang>.txt` files generally contain words which should be ignored when
processing a dictionary. 

Common examples, are articles, particles, pronouns, prepositions,....

Words that should be ignored can be specified using DJ's `ignore` directive. 
Those words, if they appear on their own and not as part of another word or
sentence, will then be ignored.

The lists are currently in a very early inception state; contributions are 
very welcome.
