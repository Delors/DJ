# Overview
Lists of words which should be removed from an entry if the entry has a respective word at the end of it.

Please note, that the `ignore` directive only considers entries as a whole while 
`discard_endings` considers the ending. However, in many cases it is possible/meaningful to use an ignore list 
also for `discard_endings`.
